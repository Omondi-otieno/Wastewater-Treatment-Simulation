# Wastewater-Treatment-Simulation
This Python-based simulation models the treatment of industrial wastewater from a paper mill using two different treatment plans. It evaluates contaminant removal across various units—like sedimentation, electrocoagulation, and rapid sand filtration—and checks compliance against recommended effluent limits.
