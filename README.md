# Wastewater-Treatment-Simulation
This Python-based simulation models the treatment of industrial wastewater from a paper mill using two different treatment plans. It evaluates contaminant removal across various unitsâ€”like sedimentation, electrocoagulation, and rapid sand filtrationâ€”and checks compliance against recommended effluent limits.

ðŸ’¡ Features
Simulates two treatment plans with distinct unit sequences

Tracks concentration changes of key parameters (BOD, COD, TSS, etc.)

Calculates compliance with effluent discharge standards

Printable tabular results using tabulate for easy visualization

ðŸ›  Technologies
Python, NumPy, Pandas

tabulate for readable output formatting
